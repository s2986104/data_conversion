  description: Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fPAR) (Coefficient
    of Variance) quantifies the solar radiation absorbed by live leaves for photosynthesis.
    This variable shows information on the importance of exchanges of energy, water
    vapor and carbon dioxide between the earths surface and the atmosphere for different
    species.
