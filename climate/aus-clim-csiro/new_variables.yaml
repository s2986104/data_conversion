  description: Isothermality quantifies how large the day-to-night temperatures oscillate
    relative to the summer- to-winter (annual) oscillations. An isothermal value of
    100 indicates the diurnal temperature range is equiva- lent to the annual temperature
    range, while anything less than 100 indicates a smaller level of temperature variability
    within an average month relative to the year. A species distribution may be influenced
    by larger or smaller temperature fluctuations within a month relative to the year
    and this predictor is useful for ascertaining such information.
