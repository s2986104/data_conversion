    "description": "A set of 35 bioclimatic variables, calculated according to the WorldClim method.  They are coded as follows: CLIMOND_01 = Annual Mean Temperature, CLIMOND_02 = Mean Diurnal Range, CLIMOND_03 = Isothermality (CLIMOND_02/CLIMOND_07), CLIMOND_04 = Temperature Seasonality, CLIMOND_05 = Max Temperature of Warmest Month, CLIMOND_06 = Min Temperature of Coldest Month, CLIMOND_07 = Temperature Annual Range (CLIMOND_05-CLIMOND_06), CLIMOND_08 = Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, CLIMOND_09 = Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter, CLIMOND_10 = Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter, CLIMOND_11 = Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter, CLIMOND_12 = Annual Precipitation, CLIMOND_13 = Precipitation of Wettest Month, CLIMOND_14 = Precipitation of Driest Month, CLIMOND_15 = Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), CLIMOND_16 = Precipitation of Wettest Quarter, CLIMOND_17 = Precipitation of Driest Quarter, CLIMOND_18 = Precipitation of Warmest Quarter, CLIMOND_19 = Precipitation of Coldest Quarter, CLIMOND_20 = Annual Mean Radiation, CLIMOND_21 = Highest Weekly Radiation, CLIMOND_22 = Lowest Weekly Radiation, CLIMOND_23 = Radiation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), CLIMOND_24 = Radiation of the Wettest Quarter, CLIMOND_25 = Radiation of the Driest Quarter, CLIMOND_26 = Radiation of the Warmest Quarter, CLIMOND_27 = Radiation of the Coldest Quarter, CLIMOND_28 = Annual Mean Moisture Index, CLIMOND_29 = Highest Weekly Moisture Index, CLIMOND_30 = Lowest Weekly Moisture Index, CLIMOND_31 = Moisture Index Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), CLIMOND_32 = Mean Moisture Index of the Wettest Quarter, CLIMOND_33 = Mean Moisture Index of the Driest Quarter, CLIMOND_34 = Mean Moisture Index of the Warmest Quarter, CLIMOND_35 = Mean Moisture Index of the Coldest Quarter",
