    "description": "A set of 7 bioclimatic variables, calculated according to the WorldClim method.  They are coded as follows: accuCLIM_01 = Annual Mean Temperature, accuCLIM_02 = Mean Diurnal Range, accuCLIM_03 = Isothermality (accuCLIM_02/accuCLIM_07), accuCLIM_04 = Temperature Seasonality, accuCLIM_05 = Max Temperature of Warmest Month, accuCLIM_06 = Min Temperature of Coldest Month, accuCLIM_07 = Temperature Annual Range (accuCLIM_05-accuCLIM_06).",
